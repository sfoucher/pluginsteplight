### Abstract
This paper introduces the STEP method (Snakes for Tuboid Extraction from Point clouds), a novel algorithm for detecting and reconstructing tubular shapes in dense, noisy, occluded, and unorganized point clouds. Originally designed for reconstructing woody parts of trees from terrestrial LiDAR data in natural forest environments, the method combines an original Hough transform with growing active contours to overcome acquisition artifacts.

### Key Contributions

#### 1. **Novel Hough Transform Variant**
- **4D Parameter Space**: Uses center coordinates (x,y,z) and radius (r) instead of classical 7-parameter approach
- **Normal Vector Integration**: Leverages point normal directions to reduce computational complexity
- **Efficient Ray Tracing**: Implements linear-time computation using ray tracing algorithms
- **Score Accumulation**: Each cell in Hough space represents a 3D circle with associated confidence score

#### 2. **Generalized Open Active Contours**
- **Growing Mechanism**: Contours grow from local maxima in Hough space
- **Energy Minimization**: Combines internal geometry constraints with data-driven attraction
- **Curve Parametrization**: Incorporates curve parametrization in data energy term
- **Growth Stopping**: Uses principal component analysis for termination criteria

#### 3. **Tuboid Definition**
- **Mathematical Framework**: Defines tuboids as ordered series of 3D circles with continuous locations, orientations, and radii
- **Envelope Representation**: Equivalent to envelope of continuous series of spheres
- **Coherent Reconstruction**: Each tuboid represents a single tree stem with direct access to DBH and taper

### Technical Implementation

#### Hough Space Computation
- **4D Discrete Space**: Three dimensions for circle center, one for radius
- **Normal Convergence**: Accumulates votes based on normal vector convergence toward circle centers
- **Filtering**: Applies filters to discard low-interest elements
- **Local Maxima**: Selects best candidates for circular cross-sections

#### Active Contour Energy
```
Eg = ∫[Ei(c(u)) + Ed(c(u))]du
```
Where:
- `Ei(c(u)) = α|c'(u)|² + β|c''(u)|²` (internal energy for elasticity and smoothness)
- `Ed(c(u))` (data energy attracting to high-score elements)

### Validation Results
- **Synthetic Data**: Tested on abstract objects with various noise and occlusion levels
- **Forest Data**: Applied to terrestrial LiDAR data from natural forest environments
- **Accuracy**: Errors in range of manual forest measurements (~1 cm diameter error)
- **Robustness**: Resilient to 75% subsampling, varying sampling densities, and noise

### Limitations
- **Normal Quality**: Results depend on accurate normal vector estimates
- **Memory Requirements**: High-dimensional Hough space requires significant memory
- **Topology**: Does not reconstruct object topology (generates independent non-intersecting tuboids)
- **Resolution Constraints**: Requires careful parameter tuning for optimal performance

### Conclusions

The STEP algorithm demonstrates superior performance for DBH estimation in challenging forest environments, particularly when dealing with occluded and noisy point clouds. While it has limitations in estimating upper trunk diameters, its automatic operation and robustness make it well-suited for operational forest inventory applications.

The study highlights the importance of algorithm selection based on specific forest conditions and measurement requirements, with each algorithm showing different strengths depending on the application context.
